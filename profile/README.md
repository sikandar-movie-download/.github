## Theatrical Release

Salman Khan's much-anticipated film, *Sikandar*, directed by A.R. Murugadoss and co-starring Rashmika Mandanna, made its theatrical debut on **March 30, 2025**, just ahead of the Eid festivities. The film's release was met with considerable excitement, marking Salman's return to the big screen after a hiatus of two years. However, the journey to the box office was not without its challenges, as the film faced an early online leak, potentially impacting its financial performance.

## Opening Day Collections

Despite the setback of online piracy, *Sikandar* managed to draw audiences to theaters. According to early estimates by industry tracker **Sacnilk**, the film garnered approximately **₹21.96 crore net in India** across all languages on its first day. This figure includes advance bookings up to 9 pm on the day of release. The film's Hindi occupancy rate stood at **20.95%**, with evening shows witnessing a peak of **25%** occupancy. Notably, *Sikandar* was showcased in over **8,000 Hindi shows** nationwide.

## Advance Bookings and Audience Reception

Prior to its release, *Sikandar* recorded advance bookings amounting to **₹10.09 crore gross**, with approximately **3.38 lakh tickets** sold across India. Maharashtra emerged as the leading state in terms of advance sales, followed closely by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

## Comparative Performance
